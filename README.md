## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

1. **index.html:**
   - Serves as the home page of the application.
   - Contains an introduction to the application and navigation links to other pages.

2. **status_benefits.html:**
   - Displays the status and benefits of different travel partners.
   - Consists of a table with columns for partner name, status, and benefits.

3. **mapping.html:**
   - Presents the mapping between different status levels of different partners.
   - Includes a table with rows representing partner names and columns representing status levels.
   - Displays the corresponding status level of each partner in the intersection of the row and column.

4. **contact.html:**
   - Offers a contact form for users to inquire about the application.
   - Consists of fields for name, email, subject, and message.

### Routes

### Additional Notes

- The specific content and design of the HTML files can be customized according to the application's requirements and user preferences.
- The database or API used to retrieve the data can be any suitable source that provides the necessary information.
- The Flask application can be further extended to include additional functionality, such as user registration, authentication, and profile management.
